This plugin is the same as the built-in **Word Count** plugin, except when you select text, it will count the selected word instead of the whole document. I recommend turning off the built-in **Word Count** because this plugin is designed to replace that. This plugin also has the ability to store statistics about your vault.

## Features

- Allows you to store statistics about your vault.
- Works with all languages.
- Can display a variety of different stats. Including:
  - Words, Characters, Sentences, Footnotes, and Pandoc Citations in current file.
  - Total Words, Characters, Sentences, Footnotes, Pandoc Citations, and Files in vault.
  - Words, Characters, Sentences, Footnotes, and Pandoc Citations typed today.
- Highly Customizable status bar that can be adapted to your needs.
